    "The IceCat Dataset, kindly provided to us by Stibo Systems, contains a large amount of data on different office products.

As such, this exercise is not so much an exercise in creating a good machine learning model, but places a larger emphasis on \"cleaning the data\".\n",

You will also be provided with a list of colors, `colors.txt`, which, when imported using the code below, is a list of tuples of the form `[(\"product ID\", \"color\"), ...]`. (The code below assumes that `colors.txt` is in the same folder as the jupyter notebook. Feel free to change the code if you prefer a different organization of your files).\n",

    "* A product may have a particular color, but a packaging of a different color. Similarly, the color of, say, a computer monitor may be black, while the image of it could show a monitor that is turned on with a green screensaver.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many products are attributed to several colors, such as \"Black, Blue\" or even \"Blue, Green, Orange, Violet, Yellow\". Yet others are described as \"Multicolor\" or \"Assorted colors\".\n",

    "In this assignment you will solve a data science problem end-to-end, pretending to be recently hired data scientists in a company. To help you get started, we've prepared a checklist to guide you through the project. Here are the main steps that you will go through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture\n",
    "2. Get the data\n",
    "3. Explore and visualise the data to gain insights\n",
    "4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms\n",
    "5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones\n",
    "6. Fine-tune your models\n",
    "7. Present your solution \n",
    "\n",
    "In each step we list a set of questions that one should have in mind when undertaking a data science project. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, but does contain a selection of the most important questions to ask. We will be available to provide assistance with each of the steps, and will allocate some part of each lesson towards working on the projects.\n",

    "    * Discretize continuous features\n",
    "    * Use one-hot encoding if/when relevant\n",
