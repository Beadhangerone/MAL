As such, this exercise is not so much an exercise in creating a good machine learning model, but places a larger emphasis on \"cleaning the data\".\n",

(The code below assumes that `colors.txt` is in the same folder as the jupyter notebook. Feel free to change the code if you prefer a different organization of your files).\n",

    "According to graphs above the arrival delay and distance are correlated almost only in case of negative delays. That means that flights flying further distances were deleyed less(so they arrived sooner) than flights flying short distances, but that's true mostly only for when the flights departed ealier than scheduled(3rd graph). For flights with regular(positive) delays there's hardly any correlation between delay time and distance(2nd graph). Concluding, there's very little correlation between two features and it's mostly influenced by negative delays. "

    "The correlation between departure and arrival time is big in case of late flights but little in case of fligts that departed before expected time. So the correlations between these two is high but lowered by negative delays where arrival delay doesn't seem to be influenced by how early(earlier than expected time) the flight departed. It could be explained by fact that if flight departed ealier than expected it won't rush and usually land in planned time as it's probably scheduled and airports might not often allow early arrivals(it's just hypothesis :)).

    "After building regression on weather data with different models it's visible that the most 'influencial' parameter is hour. Top three are: hour, month and precip(now it depends on model). Weather conditions don't really influence deperture delay much therefore it's hard to build good regression model on it."
