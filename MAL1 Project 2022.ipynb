In addition to _clean, well-documented code_ (i.e. functions with <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/\">docstrings</a>, etc), your notebook will be judged according to how well each step is explained (using Markdown). \n",

    "The IceCat Dataset, kindly provided to us by Stibo Systems, contains a large amount of data on different office products.

As such, this exercise is not so much an exercise in creating a good machine learning model, but places a larger emphasis on \"cleaning the data\".\n",

(The code below assumes that `colors.txt` is in the same folder as the jupyter notebook. Feel free to change the code if you prefer a different organization of your files).\n",

Among other things, you probably need to think about the following as you work with the data:\n",

    "* Some colors are very similar, such as \"Purple\" and \"Violet\".\n",

    "* A product may have a particular color, but a packaging of a different color. Similarly, the color of, say, a computer monitor may be black, while the image of it could show a monitor that is turned on with a green screensaver.\n",
