    "The IceCat Dataset, kindly provided to us by Stibo Systems, contains a large amount of data on different office products.

As such, this exercise is not so much an exercise in creating a good machine learning model, but places a larger emphasis on \"cleaning the data\".\n",

You will also be provided with a list of colors, `colors.txt`, which, when imported using the code below, is a list of tuples of the form `[(\"product ID\", \"color\"), ...]`. (The code below assumes that `colors.txt` is in the same folder as the jupyter notebook. Feel free to change the code if you prefer a different organization of your files).\n",
